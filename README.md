## Inspiration
When you gotta go, you gotta go. But the real question is… WHERE? In this project, we aim to provide a cleaner and clearer answer based on your fellow’s testimonials—so you could enhance your relief experience!

## What it does
**Rate The Loo** allows users to use the interactive map and find a washroom that fits their needs. This application offers 3 main features: location, rating and ranking of washrooms. The location feature shows users where washrooms are located on campus. The rating feature allows users to view washroom reviews, and overall rating as well as adding their own ratings. The ranking feature is the highlight of our application. It allows users to see which washroom has the highest rating, helping users select their best option. All of the features allow for easy navigation of washrooms, enabling users to quickly find, rate and review washrooms that best meet their standards.  

## How we built it
**Rate The Loo** utilized Python Libraries that can interact with mapping APIs to render map tiles and data for the map, Figma for assets, as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the application. 

## Challenges we ran into
Since **Rate the Loo** incorporates the UBC map, our ambition was to enhance user experience with a mapping API. As it was our first time working with APIs, it took us a while to find a beginner-friendly API. Another problem we faced was collaboration. Since our team was formed on Learn Day and most of us were unfamiliar with one another, it made our collaboration a little rough especially when it comes to idea alignment and task distribution. Over time, we successfully coordinated and had fun. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are immensely proud of our dedication to using an API. Since it was our first exposure to APIs on Learn Day, we needed help with how and where to begin with implementing a mapping API. Through thorough research and a strong commitment to learning, we eventually were able to overcome the challenge and successfully implement it.

## What we learned
We gained valuable hard skills such as APIs, Python, Figma, HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as soft skills such as communication, teamwork, problem-solving and creativity throughout the various stages of product development.  

## What's next for **Rate The Loo**
Our map functionality could be improved with a more detailed API such as the Google Maps Platform API. Additionally, we aim to implement a search bar as well as providing separate ratings for gender-designated and all-gender washrooms, making it more accessible for users to find washrooms that suit their needs. Since our application is currently focused on campus washrooms, we plan to expand the application to cover the entire city for better social good.
